        <h2>What is this?</h2>
        <p>
          Back in late 2022, I was working on a portable (as in
          <i>handheld</i>) custom keyboard with a greatly reduced number of keys
          and full support for Polish diacritics. You can already buy small
          keyboards online, but there is no <code>AltGr</code> button or there
          are other usability issues. Creating a custom keyboard was an excuse
          to try out a modern non-Arduino microcontroller, the KB2040 by
          Adafruit. Hopefully, one day, I'll finish the project!
        </p>
        <p>
          This web application can be used to render two keyboard layouts and
          get a list of missing keys for each one. It's possible to, for
          instance, compare full-size and reduced layouts (60%, 40%, or even
          smaller). Some extra features are implemented (multiple layers,
          horizontal and vertical offsets, custom labels) and presented on page
          load.
        </p>
        <p>
          This utility does some complex data transformations using Python.
          However, there is no backend because I don't want to deal with
          security and legal stuff. Python in the browser is available thanks to
          the Pyodide project, it does its job well, but loading times may be
          noticeable on lower-end hardware.
