      <h2>What is this?</h2>
      <p>
        Back in late 2022, I&nbsp;was working on a&nbsp;portable (as in
        <i>handheld</i>) custom keyboard with a&nbsp;greatly reduced number of
        keys and full support for Polish diacritics. You can already buy small
        keyboards online, but there is no <code>AltGr</code> button or there are
        other usability issues. Creating a&nbsp;custom keyboard was an excuse to
        try out a&nbsp;modern non-Arduino microcontroller, the KB2040 by
        Adafruit. Hopefully, one day, I'll finish the project!
      </p>
      <p>
        This web application can be used to render two keyboard layouts and get
        a&nbsp;list of missing keys for each one. It's possible to, for
        instance, compare full-size and reduced layouts (60%, 40%, or even
        smaller). Some extra features are implemented (multiple layers,
        horizontal and vertical offsets, custom labels) and presented on page
        load.
      </p>
      <p>
        This utility does some complex data transformations using Python.
        However, there is no backend because I&nbsp;don't want to deal with
        security and legal stuff. Python in the browser is available thanks to
        the Pyodide project, it does its job well, but loading times may be
        noticeable on lower-end hardware.
